## Features

A new way for people in high-risk groups (immunocompromised, elderly, etc.) to receive their groceries. Order yourself, or order on behalf of a family member. Alternately, help a neighbor, or member of your community out by being a volunteer shopper.

### For People Ordering Groceries:
- Create your shopping list, customize the quantity, preferred brand, and store name
- A volunteer shopper in your area will pick your order, upload a receipt with an order total, and drop off your groceries
- You can pay for just the cost of the groceries, or you can tip your shopper. Your shopper will see your preferred payment method (Venmo, Paypal, etc.) before they accept your order.
- Use your shopper’s phone number to communicate any clarifications or issues.
- Once the shopper receives your payment, they will drop off your groceries, and you will receive a notification that your order is complete.
- Communicate with your shopper via text to ensure a contactless delivery
- View your order requests and past orders at any time
- Fill out a complaint form in the app for any issues with the app or shopper
- Update your personal information as necessary in settings or when you create an order

### For People Buying And Delivering Groceries:

- While buying and delivering is a volunteer service, a requester may tip you should they want to
- Communicate with the requester via text to arrange the contactless delivery

- Fill out a complaint form in the app for any issues with the app or shopper
